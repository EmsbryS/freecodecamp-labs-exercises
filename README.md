This repository is for storing my solutions for the guided projects and labs I complete for freeCodeCamp's FullStack Development Bootcamp. 

I'm not planning on completing the full course, just the JavaScript portion of it - probably learn React while I'm at it.

I'm storing solutions here to get myself familiarized with the process of using Git and GitHub and better understand the software development lifecycle processes; not just coding, version control and other principles as well.

I understand I would not be adding code here that would be considered 'production' level code, but this is just for me to get familiar with GitHub.
